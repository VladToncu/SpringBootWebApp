# SpringBootWebApp

During my internship here, I have managed to do the following:

1. Participated in Code for Good, where I had a leader/developer position in the team. I was assigned to do the backend, where I have used Java, Java Spring and Tomcat (worked in a pair programming way). We have worked under Agile methodology, simulating a 2 week sprint into a 2-hour sprint where we would review the tasks at hand and plan for next sprint

2. I took second place in Bournemouth on the Secure Code Warrior Challenge, where I demonstrated skills in Java and C# by analysing code and determine flaws in security and possible fixes for it. Out of the first 3 people who took the first 3 places in Bournemouth, I had the highest accuracy, meaning that I could identify issues with less mistakes, proving that I know best practices in terms of security.

3. In my team, I have assisted my colleagues during every sprint that they had. I worked with Black Duck, Jenkins, Java + Unit Testing. I have also got the chance to run a Retrospective of all the teams involved in the project, which was needed in order to see dificulties in communication between teams. It was a great chance to participate in discussions and also to assess the tasks at hand. I have worked in my team in Agile methodology, where I participated in every important meeting such as Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, etc.

4. I took part in a business discussion with one of our product owners where we discussed possible design approaches or development plans for some of the tasks for future sprints.

5. I have also analysing some pieces of code of our current product in order to find out whether there are any security risks associated to the way they have designed their components.
